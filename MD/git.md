## Git Ignore File
- It is a special config file. Any files added to it will be excluded from the git repo.
- This file should be in the root folder of the repo.
- File name: `.gitignore`

```
# setup.txt will be excluded.
setup.txt

# All files with the extension .sh will be excluded.
*.sh

# folder bin will be excluded.

| `git show [commit\|file]` | show changes for commit or file |
| `git blame [file]` | show last modified revisions & authors for file |

**Note :** <br>
\- `HEAD` is a pointer which points at the current working tree and working branch.


## Staging and Unstaging
| Command | Info |
| --- | --- |
| `git add [file]` | add file to stage area or index |
| `git add .` | add all changes to stage area or index |
| `git add -A` | add all changes to stage area or index |
| `git restore [file]` | discard changes in working directory |
| `git restore --staged [file]` | unstage file |
| `git rm -r [file]` | remove file or folder from working tree and index |
| `git checkout .` | delete all unstage changes or restore working tree |
| `git checkout -- [file]` | discard changes to file |
| `git checkout [commit]` | move/switch HEAD to specified commit, in detached HEAD state |

**Note :** <br>
\- Working tree = unstaged = untracked <br>
\- Index = staged = tracked


## Commit and Rebase
| Command | Info |
| --- | --- |
| `git commit` | commit staged changes |
| `git commit -m "commit message"` | commit staged changes with commit message |
| `git commit -a -m "commit message"` | stage and commit changes (git add+commit) |
| `git revert [commit]` | revert commit by producing new commit |
| `git commit --amend` | amend/change last commit |
| `git commit --amend --no-edit` | amend last commit without changing commit message |
| `git commit --amend -m "commit message` | amend last commit with changing message |
| `git rebase` | merge branch without creating additional merge commit |
| `git rebase -i HEAD~n` | squash commits ie combine series of commits and condense it to few commits interactively |

**Note :** <br>
\- Never rebase on public branch. Other teams may face conflicts as rebasing changes checksums.


## Reset
| Command | Info |
| --- | --- |
| `git reset` | reset current HEAD to specified state (reset index) |
| `git reset HEAD~n` | reset HEAD to last n-th commit |
| `git reset --soft [commit]` | doesn't touch index file or working tree but resets head to commit |
| `git reset --mixed [commit]` | resets index but not working tree ie changed files are preserved but not marked for commit (default action) |
| `git reset --hard [commit]` | resets index and working tree, Any changes to tracked files in working tree since commit are discarded |

**Note :** <br>
\- `checkout` vs `reset` <br>
Git reset is specifically about updating the index and moving the HEAD. <br>
Git checkout is about updating the working tree (to the index or the specified tree). <br>
It will update the HEAD only if you checkout a branch (if not, then you end up with a detached HEAD).


## Push
| Command | Info |
| --- | --- |
| `git push` | push commited changes to remote (default or remembered branch) |
| `git push [remote] [branch]` | push commited changes to remote branch |
| `git push -u origin [branch]` | push commited changes to remote branch & remember branch |
| `git push origin --delete [branch]` | delete remote branch |
| `git push -f` | force push changes, required when command refuses to update remote ref that is not ancestor of local ref (usally happen with rebase) |
| `git push --force-with-lease` | when rebased on already pushed changes, force pushing will lose pushed commit history by others. Force with lease gives flexibility to override new commits on your remote branch, while protecting old commit history |

**Note :** <br>
\- Use `force-with-lease` option instead of `f` with push.
