                <h4 class="heading"># Internet</h4>
                <p>The internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that use standardized communication protocols to exchange data and information. For effective communication and organization on a network, devices need to have clear identification and be recognizable by others which is typically occurs through unique identifiers assigned to each device, such as IP addresses or MAC addresses. These identifiers enable devices to send and receive data, facilitating communication and maintaining order within the network.</p>
                <div>
                    <h5>IP Address :</h5>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>An IP (or Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.</li>
                        <li>It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in the network.</li>
                        <li>It is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting.</li>
                        <li>A device's IP address can be changed, but two devices cannot have the same IP address within the same network.</li>
                        <li>An IP address is of two types: public or private. A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices on a local network.</li>
                        <li><b>Ping :</b> The <code>ping</code> command is used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable.</li>
                    </ul>
               
                    <h5>MAC Address :</h5>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication at the data link layer of a network segment. It serves as a hardware address that distinguishes one device from another on a network.</li>
                        <li>The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number split into two's and separated by a colon. The first six characters represent the vendor/company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.</li>
                        <li>MAC addresses can be faked or spoofed in a process known as spoofing. This spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify another using its MAC address.</li>
                    </ul>
               
                    <h5>Port Address :</h5>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>A port address is a numeric value used to uniquely identify different communication endpoints in a network.</li>
                        <li>In a node, multiple processes are running, and data that is sent or received must reach the right process.</li>
                        <li>Every process in the node is uniquely identified using a port number, which is used to route data packets to the correct destination.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="sections" id="url">
                <h4 class="heading"># URL</h4>
                <p>A URL (or Uniform Resource Locator) is predominantly an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet.</p>
                <h6>Ex :</h6>
                <div class="code-box code-box-color"><code>http://user:password@example.com:80/view?id=1#task2</code></div>
                <ul class="justify">
                    <li><b>Scheme (<code>http</code>) :</b> This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP.</li>
                    <li><b>User (<code>user:password</code>) :</b> Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a username and password into the URL to log in.</li>
                    <li><b>Host (<code>example.com</code>) :</b> The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access.</li>
                    <li><b>Port (<code>80</code>) :</b> The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.</li>
                    <li><b>Path (<code>/view</code>) :</b> The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access.</li>
                    <li><b>Query String (<code>/view?id=1</code>) :</b> Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path.</li>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="sections" id="dns">
                <h4 class="heading"># DNS</h4>
                <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like google.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as <code>192.168.1.1</code> (in IPv4).</p>
                <ul class="justify">
                    <li><b>Domain Name Resolution :</b> When a domain name is entered into a web browser, the device first checks its local DNS cache to see if the corresponding IP address exists. If not, it sends a request to a DNS server.</li>
                    <li><b>DNS Server Lookup :</b> The device sends a query to a DNS server, provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). If the DNS server has the requested information in its cache, it returns the IP address to the device. If not, it queries other DNS servers until it finds the information or determines that it doesn't exist.</li>
                    <li><b>Response :</b> Once the DNS server has the IP address corresponding to the requested domain name, it sends that information back to the device. The device can then connect to the server hosting the requested website and access the website.</li>
                    <li><b>NSLookup :</b> The <code>nslookup</code> is used for querying Domain Name System (DNS) servers to obtain information about domain names, IP addresses, and DNS records. It stands for Name Server Lookup.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Domain Hierarchy :</b> Domain Hierarchy refers to the structure and organization of domain names within the Domain Name System (DNS).</p>

            <div class="sections" id="protocol">
                <h4 class="heading"># Protocols</h4>
                <p>In computer networking, protocols are a set of rules or conventions that govern how data is transmitted between devices on a network.<br>
                There are numerous protocols at different layers of the networking stack, such as -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Internet Protocol (IP) :</h6>
                        <p>Fundamental protocol responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so they can travel across networks and reach their intended destinations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) :</h6>
                        <p>TCP is a protocol that operates at a higher level than IP and is responsible for establishing and maintaining connections between devices, ensuring reliable and ordered delivery of data. If data is lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP detects this and retransmits the lost or corrupted packets. TCP is connection-oriented, meaning a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages. This connection's establishment and termination involve a handshake process. TCP is used in web browsers (in HTTP), email, file transfer, and instant/realtime messaging.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) :</h6>
                        <p>UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means it doesn't establish a connection before sending data and doesn't guarantee delivery of packets or the order of packets. Each UDP packet is independent of the others. UDP offers lower latency compared to TCP due to its connectionless nature, no handshake, minimal overhead, and no retransmissions. It is often used for time-sensitive applications where speed is prioritized over reliability. UDP is commonly used in VoIP applications, video streaming, online gaming, DNS, and DHCP.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) :</h6>
                        <p>The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol used for transferring hypermedia documents, such as HTML files, on the World Wide Web. It is the foundation of data communication on the web, and HTTP uses a client-server model, where clients initiate requests and servers respond with the requested resources. HTTP operates over TCP/IP, which ensures reliable delivery of data packets over networks. The protocol is stateless, meaning each request from a client is independent and not dependent on previous requests.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) :</h6>
                        <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP used for secure communication over a computer network, particularly the internet. It encrypts the data sent and received between a user's browser and the website server, ensuring that the information remains confidential and protected from interception or tampering by unauthorized parties. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocols to establish an encrypted connection between the client and the server.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) :</h6>
                        <p>SMTP, or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is a communication protocol used for transmitting electronic mail (email) between computers over a network. It defines how email messages should be formatted and transmitted.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) :</h6>
                        <p>FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It specifies how files should be transferred and accessed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) :</h6>
                        <p>It is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on a network. DHCP eliminates the need for manual configuration of network settings.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="heading"># TCP/IP Model</h4>
                <p>The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria. The foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Internet Protocol (IP). The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Application Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The application layer is the top layer and provides applications with standardized data exchange. Its protocols include HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, DNS, DHCP and SNMP. At the application layer, the payload is the actual application data.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Transport Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The transport layer is responsible for maintaining end-to-end communications across the network. TCP handles communications between hosts and provides flow control, multiplexing and reliability. The transport protocols include TCP and UDP.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Internet Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The internet layer, also called the network layer, deals with packets and connects independent networks to transport the packets across network boundaries. The network layer protocols are IP and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which are used for error reporting.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Network Access Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The network Access layer, also known as the network interface layer or data link layer, consists of protocols that operate only on a link -- the network component that interconnects nodes or hosts in the network. The protocols in this lowest layer include Ethernet for local area networks and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).</p>

            <div class="sections" id="osi-model">
                <h4 class="heading"># OSI Model</h4>
                <p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a reference model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection. In the OSI reference model, the communications between systems are split into seven different abstraction layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. The modern Internet is not based on OSI but on the simpler TCP/IP model.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Application Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application layer protocols are HTTP, FTP, POP, SMTP, and DNS.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Presentation Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Session Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices. It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Transport Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end. It is responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Network Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end. The other is routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical network. The network layer uses network addresses (typically Internet Protocol addresses) to route packets to a destination node.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Data Link Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network. It breaks up packets into frames and sends them from source to destination.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h6>Physical Layer :</h6>
                        <p>The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes. It defines the connector, the electrical cable or wireless technology connecting the devices, and is responsible for the transmission of the raw data.</p>
