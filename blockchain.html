                    <p>A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized ledger of transactions. Blockchains record a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, secured from tampering and revision.</li>
                        <li>Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block.</li>
                        <li>A blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks.</li>
                        <li>Once recorded, information cannot be altered without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>&bull; Genesis Block :</h5>
                    <p>The Genesis Block, also known as Block 0, is the very first block upon which additional blocks in a blockchain are added. It is effectively the ancestor that every other block can trace its lineage back to since every block references the one preceding it. The Genesis Block is a critical element of a blockchain network because it serves as the foundation for the entire network.</p>

                    <h5>&bull; Blockchain Explorer :</h5>
                    <p>A blockchain explorer is a platform that allows people to search and navigate a blockchain. They're not necessary for using the blockchain. However, they offer a valuable service to those who wish to inspect a blockchain in detail. You can view transactions on the blockchain, smart contract code, account balances, and more.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions encoded on a blockchain. They are written in programming languages such as Solidity (for Ethereum) or Vyper and operate autonomously without the need for intermediaries.</p>

                    <h5>&bull; Web3.JS :</h5>
                    <p>Web3.JS is a popular JavaScript library that allows you to interact with the Ethereum network (and smart contracts). If you want to build an application, you can use Web3.JS to connect to the Ethereum blockchain and make the front-end of your application.</p>

                    <h5>&bull; ABI Bytecode :</h5>
                    <p>ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. The ABI is typically provided as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file or an ABI-encoded string. Smart contracts are written in high-level languages like Solidity and compiled into bytecode, which is then deployed on the blockchain or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for execution. The ABI Array contains all functions, inputs, and outputs, as well as all variables and their types, from a smart contract. Inside, there are assembly opcodes telling the EVM during execution of a smart contract where to jump to. Those jump destinations are the first 4 bytes of the keccak hash of the function signature.</p>

            <div class="sections" id="consensus-mechanism">
                <h4 class="heading"># Consensus Mechanism</h4>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Blockchain networks rely on a consensus mechanism to achieve agreement among nodes about the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain. Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).</p>

                    <h5>&bull; Proof of Work (PoW) :</h5>
            		<p>In a PoW-based blockchain network, miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle or algorithm. The process of solving this puzzle is called mining.</p>

            		<h5>&bull; Proof of Stake (PoS) :</h5>
            		<p>In a PoS-based blockchain network, participants are called validators. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and "stake" in the network.</p>

            		<h6>PoW and PoS :</h6>
                    <p>In a PoW system, miners compete to find a solution to an equation that will allow them to add a block to the blockchain. In a PoS system, validators stake their cryptocurrency on the chain they want to mine. The more they stake, the more likely they will solve the next block. When they reach a consensus on a block, they get rewarded with more of the cryptocurrency. Critics argue that PoS may lead to centralization.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>A token refers to a digital asset or a unit of value that is created, issued, and transferred within a blockchain system. Tokens can represent various types of assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, or even non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>

                    <h5>&bull; Fungible Tokens :</h5>
                    <p>A fungible token is a type of digital asset that is interchangeable with other tokens of the same type. Fungible tokens are identical, non-unique and indistinguishable from one another, meaning that each token holds the same value and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.</p>

                    <h5>&bull; Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) :</h5>
                    <p>Non-Fungible Tokens are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity for a specific item or piece of content. NFTs have gained popularity in digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, and gaming. Each NFT has a distinct value and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis like cryptocurrencies. One token may be similar to another, but they have properties that ensure no two tokens can ever be the same.</p>

                    <p>ERC-20 stands for Ethereum Request for Comment 20, which is a technical standard or protocol used for creating and implementing fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of rules and standards that a token contract must follow in order to be considered an ERC-20 token. ERC-20 allows developers to create smart-contract-enabled tokens that can be used with other products and services.</p>
                    <h6>ERC-20 Contents :</h6>
                    <p>ERC-20 is a list of functions and events that must be implemented into a token for it to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These functions (called methods in the ERC) describe what must be included in the smart-contract-enabled token, while events describe an action.</p>

                    <ul class="justify">
