                    <li>A blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks.</li>

                    <p>The Genesis Block, also known as Block 0, is the very first block upon which additional blocks in a blockchain are added. It is effectively the ancestor that every other block can trace its lineage back to since every block references the one preceding it. The Genesis Block is a critical element of a blockchain network because it serves as the foundation for the entire network.</p>

                <p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions encoded on a blockchain. They are written in programming languages such as Solidity (for Ethereum) or Vyper and operate autonomously without the need for intermediaries.</p>

                    <p>ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. The ABI is typically provided as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file or an ABI-encoded string. Smart contracts are written in high-level languages like Solidity and compiled into bytecode, which is then deployed on the blockchain or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for execution. The ABI Array contains all functions, inputs, and outputs, as well as all variables and their types, from a smart contract. Inside, there are assembly opcodes telling the EVM during execution of a smart contract where to jump to. Those jump destinations are the first 4 bytes of the keccak hash of the function signature.</p>

                <p>Blockchain networks rely on a consensus mechanism to achieve agreement among nodes about the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain. Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).</p>

                    <h5>&bull; Proof of Work (PoW) :</h5>

            		<h5>&bull; Proof of Stake (PoS) :</h5>
            		<p>In a PoS-based blockchain network, participants are called validators. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and "stake" in the network.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
            		<h6>PoW and PoS :</h6>
                    <p>In a PoW system, miners compete to find a solution to an equation that will allow them to add a block to the blockchain. In a PoS system, validators stake their cryptocurrency on the chain they want to mine. The more they stake, the more likely they will solve the next block. When they reach a consensus on a block, they get rewarded with more of the cryptocurrency. Critics argue that PoS may lead to centralization.</p>

                <p>A token refers to a digital asset or a unit of value that is created, issued, and transferred within a blockchain system. Tokens can represent various types of assets, such as cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, or even non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
                <div>
                    <h5>&bull; Fungible Tokens :</h5>
                    <p>A fungible token is a type of digital asset that is interchangeable with other tokens of the same type. Fungible tokens are identical, non-unique and indistinguishable from one another, meaning that each token holds the same value and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.</p>

                    <p>Non-Fungible Tokens are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity for a specific item or piece of content. NFTs have gained popularity in digital art, collectibles, virtual real estate, and gaming. Each NFT has a distinct value and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis like cryptocurrencies. One token may be similar to another, but they have properties that ensure no two tokens can ever be the same.</p>

                    <h6>ERC-20 Contents :</h6>
                    <p>ERC-20 is a list of functions and events that must be implemented into a token for it to be considered ERC-20 compliant. These functions (called methods in the ERC) describe what must be included in the smart-contract-enabled token, while events describe an action.</p>
