                        <li>
                            <h6>Confidentiality :</h6>
                            <p>Assurance that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. Encryption, access controls, and authentication are used to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Integrity :</h6>
                            <p>The trustworthiness of data or resources is maintained by preventing improper or unauthorized changes. Hashing, checksums, and digital signatures are implemented to prevent and detect such modifications.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Availability :</h6>
                            <p>Assurance that systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible to authorized users when needed. Redundancy, backups, and robust disaster recovery plans are implemented to ensure continuous access to resources.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Authenticity* :</h6>
                            <p>Authenticity ensures that the origin of information or communication is genuine and the source is verified as legitimate. It is achieved using digital signatures, certificates, public key infrastructure (PKI), authentication protocols (such as usernames, passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication), and message authentication codes (MACs).</p>
                        </li>

                            <h6>Non-Repudiation* :</h6>
                            <p>Non-repudiation ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their actions, such as sending a message or signing a document. It provides proof of origin and delivery, ensuring accountability. It is achieved using digital signatures, audit logs, message receipts, and secure time stamping.</p>

                            <h6>Regulations :</h6>
                            <p>Regulations are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from the government, and carry financial penalties and/or imprisonment for non-compliance. For example, the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) were enacted by the European Union (EU) to control the use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its citizens and those in the EU.</p>

                            <p>Standards are often used by government teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops and publishes international standards on a variety of technical subjects, including information systems and information security. And another is the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a United States government agency.</p>
                        </li>

                    <p>When leaders and management implement the systems and structure that the organization will use to achieve its goals, they are guided by laws and regulations created by the government to enact public policy. Laws and regulations guide the development of standards that cultivate policies that result in procedures.</p>
