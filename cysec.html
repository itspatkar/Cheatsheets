                    <p>Encryption is the process of transforming readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext to mask sensitive information from unauthorized users. Encryption is used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and data breaches. Encryption works by using encryption algorithms to encrypt data into an indecipherable format. Only authorized parties with the right secret key, known as the decryption key, can decrypt the data.</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Plaintext :</b> Plaintext is the original, readable data or message in its unencrypted form. Its meaning or value is immediately accessible and usable by the end user (person or a process).</li>
                        <li><b>Ciphertext :</b> Ciphertext is the encrypted, unreadable data or message and is not interpretable without the decryption key.</li>
                        <li><b>Encryption Algorithm :</b> An encryption algorithm is a mathematical procedure used to transform data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext). This transformation process is achieved using a set of rules and a cryptographic key.</li>

                    <h5>Checksum :</h5>
                    <p>A checksum is a small-sized piece of data generated from a larger set of data, used for error detection in data transmission and storage. When the data is transmitted or stored, the checksum is sent or saved alongside it. A checksum is computed by applying a mathematical algorithm (e.g., CRC32, MD5, SHA-1) to the data. Checksum is used in error detection in file transfers, storage, and network protocols (e.g., CRC checks in network protocols like Ethernet or ZIP file integrity).</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>Checksums are fast and efficient for detecting accidental data corruption but are not designed for security purposes; they don't provide a high level of protection against malicious tampering.</li>
                        <li>For data integrity and colision resistance, more robust and secure hashes are used.</li>

                    <p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework that manages digital keys and certificates, enabling secure communication and data exchange over untrusted networks (like the internet). PKI ensures that public keys are properly distributed, authenticated, and managed so that secure transactions and communications can occur between parties. PKI involves a set of hardware, software, policies, and standards that work together to provide services such as encryption, authentication, and digital signatures using public key cryptography.</p>

                            <p>The CA is the trusted entity responsible for issuing and managing digital certificates. The CA validates the identity of the entity requesting a certificate before issuing it. Essentially, the CA vouches for the authenticity of a public key and the identity behind it. Example: DigiCert, GlobalSign, Let's Encrypt.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>The RA acts as an intermediary between users and the CA. When a user requests a digital certificate, the RA verifies the applicant’s identity (documents or database checks). Once the RA validates the request, it sends it to the CA for final approval and certificate issuance. The RA does not issue certificates but plays a key role in the identity verification process.</p>

                        <li>SIEM tools collect, aggregate, and analyze data from various sources, such as security logs, network traffic, and endpoint devices, to detect potential security incidents, vulnerabilities, or breaches.</li>
                        <li>Characteristics of SIEM are log management, event correlation, and real-time monitoring; incident detection and alerts; reporting and compliance; and forensics and analysis.</li>
                        <li>Logs are the raw data generated by systems and provide detailed records of activities. And SIEM is a tool that aggregates, normalizes, and analyzes these logs in real-time to detect security threats, providing more advanced insights, automation, and compliance reporting.</li>
                        <li>While logs provide the foundational data, SIEM platforms use that data to enhance security monitoring and response, making SIEM an essential tool for managing and interpreting logs in the context of cybersecurity.</li>
                        <li>Example: Splunk, a popular SIEM platform that helps organizations monitor, analyze, and respond to security events and incidents.</li>

                    <p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are security tools designed to detect unauthorized access or anomalies in a network or system. IDS monitors and analyzes network traffic, system activity, and user behavior to identify potential security breaches, such as cyberattacks or data theft, and alerts administrators to take action. IDS automate the inspection of logs and real-time system events to detect intrusion attempts and system failures.</p>
                    <h6>Type of IDS -</h6>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Network-based IDS (NIDS) :</b> HIDs monitor activity on individual devices or hosts (servers, computers). It is installed on the host device, where it monitors file integrity, system calls, and application logs. It detects internal threats and activities like unauthorized access to files and malicious changes to system configurations.</li>
                        <li><b>Host-based IDS (HIDS) :</b> NIDs monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. It is placed at strategic points within the network (e.g., between the internal network and the internet). It detects external attacks like denial-of-service (DoS) and port scanning.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Intrusion Prevention Systems :</h5>
                    <p>An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security device that monitors network and/or system activities for malicious activity. IPS is placed in line with traffic and is more advanced than an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). IPS not only detects but also automatically blocks or prevents the detected threats in real time to prevent unauthorized access or attacks on computer systems and networks. Since IPSs are more effective at preventing network-based attacks, their function is integrated into firewalls.</p>
                    <h6>Types of IPS -</h6>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Network-based IPS (NIPS) :</b> These are deployed at key points in the network (e.g., network perimeter) to monitor and protect the entire network.</li>
                        <li><b>Host-based IPS (HIPS) :</b> Installed on individual devices or hosts, HIPS protect against threats targeting a specific machine, such as a server or endpoint.</li>
                        <li><b>Wireless IPS (WIPS) :</b> A specialized IPS designed to protect wireless networks from unauthorized access or attacks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Firewalls :</h5>
                    <p>A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. These rules can be configured to permit or deny traffic based on factors such as IP address, port number, protocol, or specific applications. Firewalls can be hardware devices, software programs, or a combination of both. Firewalls use a variety of techniques to control and monitor network traffic, including packet filtering, stateful inspection, and application-level filtering. It blocks unauthorized access and filters out malicious traffic.</p>
                    <h6>Types of Firewall -</h6>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Network-based Firewall</b> : A network firewall is a device that protects an entire network from unauthorized access and attacks. Network firewalls can be hardware or software based and are typically installed at the perimeter of a network to block unauthorized access from the internet.</li>
                        <li><b>Host-based Firewall :</b> A host-based firewall is a firewall that protects an individual computer from unauthorized access and attacks. Host-based firewalls are typically software-based and are installed on individual computers to control access to network resources and block unauthorized traffic.</li>

                <h4 class="heading"># Access Control</h4>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Access control is the process and mechanism that restrict and manage access to systems, data, or resources within an organization. It limits the visibility, access, and use of resources in a computing environment. This ensures that only authorized users can access information, resources, and systems while preventing unauthorized access that could lead to data breaches, system vulnerabilities, or cyberattacks.</p>
                    <h6>Types of Access Control Models -</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) :</h6>
                            <p>The owner of a resource has the authority to grant or deny access to others. Access rights are determined based on the discretion of the resource owner. Once a user is given permission to access an object (usually by a system administrator or through an existing access control list), they can grant access to other users on an as-needed basis. Example: A file owner on a system determines who can read, write, or execute the file.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) :</h6>
                            <p>Access decisions are made based on predetermined policies set by an administrator, not the resource owner. Resources are classified (e.g., top secret, confidential, public), and users are assigned clearance levels. Mandatory access control establishes strict security policies for individual users and the resources, systems, or data they are allowed to access. Example: Military or governmental organizations often use MAC, where access is based on security clearances.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) :</h6>
                            <p>Access rights are assigned based on roles within an organization, rather than individual users. Users are granted permissions according to the role they are assigned (e.g., admin, manager, employee). Individuals can perform any action that is assigned to their role and may be assigned multiple roles as necessary. Example: An admin has full access, while regular users may have read-only access to certain files.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Rule-Based Access Control :</h6>
                            <p>A set of rules is established to determine access; these rules are based on specific conditions (e.g., network location, device, or specific times of day). RuBAC is an extension of RBAC in which access is governed by a set of rules that the organization prescribes. Example: Allowing access to certain systems only when a user is connected from the company's secure network.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Microsegmentation :</h5>
                    <p>Microsegmentation is the practice of breaking up security perimeters into small zones to maintain separate access for separate parts of the network. Networks are divided into smaller, isolated segments to reduce the lateral movement of potential attackers. Each segment has its own security policy, making it more difficult for threats to spread across the network.</p>
                    <h5>Zero Trust :</h5>
                    <p>Zero Trust is a security framework that operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It requires strict identity verification and access control for every user, device, application, and network trying to access resources, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the corporate network.</p>
                    <h6>Key Principles of Zero Trust -</h6>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Never Trust, Always Verify :</b> Every request for access to systems, applications, or data is treated as though it is coming from an untrusted source, even if the request originates from inside the network.</li>
                        <li><b>Least Privilege Access :</b> Users and devices are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the potential attack surface. This includes enforcing strict access control policies and limiting user permissions.</li>
                        <li><b>Micro-Segmentation :</b> Zero Trust networks also utilize microsegmentation. Networks are divided into smaller, isolated segments to reduce the lateral movement of potential attackers. Each segment has its own security policy, making it more difficult for threats to spread across the network.</li>
                        <li><b>Continuous Monitoring and Validation :</b> Security controls are constantly evaluated, and access rights are continuously reassessed to ensure they are still appropriate based on the context (e.g., location, device, role, behavior). This helps in identifying and mitigating anomalies.</li>
                        <li><b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) :</b> Strong authentication mechanisms are implemented to ensure that only authorized users and devices can access critical resources. MFA requires multiple forms of identity verification, such as passwords and biometrics or tokens.</li>

                    <p>Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks to an organization's digital assets, systems, and information. It includes risk assessments and audits, vulnerability scanning, implementing preventive measures such as firewalls, encryption, or multi-factor authentication, and developing risk management frameworks and policies.</p>
                    <h5>Incident Response :</h5>
                    <p>Incident Response (IR) refers to the organized approach taken by an organization to detect, respond to, manage, and recover from security incidents, such as cyberattacks, data breaches, or other malicious activities. The goal of incident response is to minimize the impact of an incident, restore normal operations as quickly as possible, and learn from the event to improve future security measures.</p>
