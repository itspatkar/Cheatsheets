                            <b>Offensive Security (Red Team) :</b> Attacking - Offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting vulnerabilities, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Defensive Security (Blue Team) :</b> Defending/Preventing - Defensive security is the process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential threats.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>SOC :</b> The Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of IT security professionals tasked with  monitoring, preventing, detecting, investigating, and responding to threats within a company’s network and systems.
                        </li>

                            <b>OSINT :</b> Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the act of gathering and analyzing publicly available data for intelligence purposes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Threat Intelligence :</b> Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.

                        <li>
                            <b>OWASP :</b> The Open Web Application Security Project is a nonprofit foundation focused on understanding web technologies and exploitations and provides resources and tools designed to improve the security of software applications.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>IDOR :</b> Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. Broken access control means that an attacker can access information or perform actions not intended for them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Virus :</b> Virus is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program. It is designed to spread from one computer to another; moreover, it works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer. The result ranges from the computer becoming slow to unusable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Trojan Horse :</b> Trojan Horse is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath. For example, a victim might download a video player from a shady website that gives the attacker complete control over their system.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Ransomware :</b> Ransomware is a malicious program that encrypts the user’s files. Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password. The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay a ransom.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>HTML Injection :</b> HTML Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page. If a website fails to sanitise user input (filter any "malicious" text that a user inputs into a website), and that input is used on the page, an attacker can inject HTML code into a vulnerable website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>SQL Injection :</b> Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi) is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed. When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that hasn't been properly validated, there runs the potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete or alter private and customer data and also attack the web application authentication methods to private or customer areas. - If web server of dbms throws sql error directly then it has sql injection vulnerability.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>TOR :</b> The Onion Router (TOR) is a network technology designed to improve your privacy and security on the internet by creating an anonymous communication pathway. It works by routing your internet traffic through a series of volunteer-operated servers (nodes) that encrypt and re-encrypt the data multiple times, making it very difficult to trace back to the original user.
