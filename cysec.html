                            <p>Procedures are the detailed steps to complete tasks that support departmental or organizational policies.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When leaders and management implement the systems and structure that the organization will use to achieve its goals, they are guided by laws and regulations created by the government to enact public policy. Laws and regulations guide the development of standards that cultivate policies that result in procedures.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The CIA Triad serves as the foundation of information security, and all three aspects must be addressed to ensure comprehensive cybersecurity.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Confidentiality :</h6>
                            <p>Assurance that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. Encryption, access controls, and authentication are used to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Integrity :</h6>
                            <p>The trustworthiness of data or resources is maintained by preventing improper or unauthorized changes. Hashing, checksums, and digital signatures are implemented to prevent and detect such modifications.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Availability :</h6>
                            <p>Assurance that systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible to authorized users when needed. Redundancy, backups, and robust disaster recovery plans are implemented to ensure continuous access to resources.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Authenticity* :</h6>
                            <p>Authenticity ensures that the origin of information or communication is genuine and the source is verified as legitimate. It is achieved using digital signatures, certificates, public key infrastructure (PKI), authentication protocols (such as usernames, passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication), and message authentication codes (MACs).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Non-Repudiation* :</h6>
                            <p>Non-repudiation ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their actions, such as sending a message or signing a document.

            <div class="sections" id="access-control">
                <h4 class="heading"># Access Control</h4>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Access control is the process and mechanism that restrict and manage access to systems, data, or resources within an organization. It limits the visibility, access, and use of resources in a computing environment. This ensures that only authorized users can access information, resources, and systems while preventing unauthorized access that could lead to data breaches, system vulnerabilities, or cyberattacks.</p>
                    <h6>Types of Access Control Models -</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) :</h6>
                            <p>The owner of a resource has the authority to grant or deny access to others. Access rights are determined based on the discretion of the resource owner. Once a user is given permission to access an object (usually by a system administrator or through an existing access control list), they can grant access to other users on an as-needed basis. Example: A file owner on a system determines who can read, write, or execute the file.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) :</h6>
                            <p>Access decisions are made based on predetermined policies set by an administrator, not the resource owner. Resources are classified (e.g., top secret, confidential, public), and users are assigned clearance levels. Mandatory access control establishes strict security policies for individual users and the resources, systems, or data they are allowed to access. Example: Military or governmental organizations often use MAC, where access is based on security clearances.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) :</h6>
                            <p>Access rights are assigned based on roles within an organization, rather than individual users. Users are granted permissions according to the role they are assigned (e.g., admin, manager, employee). Individuals can perform any action that is assigned to their role and may be assigned multiple roles as necessary. Example: An admin has full access, while regular users may have read-only access to certain files.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Rule-Based Access Control :</h6>
                            <p>A set of rules is established to determine access; these rules are based on specific conditions (e.g., network location, device, or specific times of day). RuBAC is an extension of RBAC in which access is governed by a set of rules that the organization prescribes. Example: Allowing access to certain systems only when a user is connected from the company's secure network.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Microsegmentation :</h5>
                    <p>Microsegmentation is the practice of breaking up security perimeters into small zones to maintain separate access for separate parts of the network. Networks are divided into smaller, isolated segments to reduce the lateral movement of potential attackers. Each segment has its own security policy, making it more difficult for threats to spread across the network.</p>
                    <h5>Zero Trust :</h5>
                    <p>Zero Trust is a security framework that operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It requires strict identity verification and access control for every user, device, application, and network trying to access resources, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the corporate network.</p>
                    <h6>Key Principles of Zero Trust -</h6>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Never Trust, Always Verify :</b> Every request for access to systems, applications, or data is treated as though it is coming from an untrusted source, even if the request originates from inside the network.</li>
                        <li><b>Least Privilege Access :</b> Users and devices are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the potential attack surface. This includes enforcing strict access control policies and limiting user permissions.</li>
                        <li><b>Micro-Segmentation :</b> Zero Trust networks also utilize microsegmentation. Networks are divided into smaller, isolated segments to reduce the lateral movement of potential attackers. Each segment has its own security policy, making it more difficult for threats to spread across the network.</li>
                        <li><b>Continuous Monitoring and Validation :</b> Security controls are constantly evaluated, and access rights are continuously reassessed to ensure they are still appropriate based on the context (e.g., location, device, role, behavior). This helps in identifying and mitigating anomalies.</li>
                        <li><b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) :</b> Strong authentication mechanisms are implemented to ensure that only authorized users and devices can access critical resources. MFA requires multiple forms of identity verification, such as passwords and biometrics or tokens.</li>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. It serves as a virtual equivalent of a handwritten signature or a stamped seal, but with much more security. Digital signatures are based on asymmetric cryptography (also called public-key cryptography). It is used in email signing, software distribution, legal documents (contracts, agreements, and other legally binding documents), and blockchain.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework that manages digital keys and certificates, enabling secure communication and data exchange over untrusted networks (like the internet). PKI ensures that public keys are properly distributed, authenticated, and managed so that secure transactions and communications can occur between parties. PKI involves a set of hardware, software, policies, and standards that work together to provide services such as encryption, authentication, and digital signatures using public key cryptography.</p>
                    <h6>Key Components of PKI -</h6>

                            <h6>Certificate Authority (CA) :</h6>
                            <p>The CA is the trusted entity responsible for issuing and managing digital certificates. The CA validates the identity of the entity requesting a certificate before issuing it. Essentially, the CA vouches for the authenticity of a public key and the identity behind it. Example: DigiCert, GlobalSign, Let's Encrypt.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>The RA acts as an intermediary between users and the CA. When a user requests a digital certificate, the RA verifies the applicant’s identity (documents or database checks). Once the RA validates the request, it sends it to the CA for final approval and certificate issuance. The RA does not issue certificates but plays a key role in the identity verification process.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>A digital certificate is an electronic document that binds a public key to an identity (e.g., an individual, organization, or device). It contains the public key, the identity of the certificate holder, and the CA’s signature confirming its authenticity. <code>X.509</code> certificates are the most common format for digital certificates. Key fields of a digital certificate include the public key (associated with the user or entity), the subject (owner's identity, e.g., domain, email, or organizational entity), the issuer (Certificate Authority), the serial number (a unique identifier for the certificate.), the expiration date (certificate validity period), and the digital signature (the CA's signature confirming the certificate's authenticity).</p>

                    <p>SecOps (Security Operations) is a crucial discipline in cybersecurity that focuses on the integration of security practices and IT operations to ensure the continuous protection, monitoring, and management of an organization's infrastructure, networks, and data.</p>
                    <h5>Logging and Monitoring :</h5>
                    <p>Logging refers to the practice of recording detailed information about events, processes, and actions that occur within a system or network.</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>These records, called logs, provide a history of events and activities that can be used for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, security auditing, and incident response.</li>
                        <li>A log contains information such as user IDs, system activities, dates and times of key events, device and location identity, system and resource access attempts, system configurations, network traffic, and track or history of events.</li>
                        <li>A log should be stored separately from the system where it is generated.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Security Information and Event Management :</h5>
                    <p>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a system or tool used to provide real-time monitoring, analysis, and response to security threats across an organization's IT infrastructure.</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li>SIEM tools collect, aggregate, and analyze data from various sources, such as security logs, network traffic, and endpoint devices, to detect potential security incidents, vulnerabilities, or breaches.</li>
                        <li>Characteristics of SIEM are log management, event correlation, and real-time monitoring; incident detection and alerts; reporting and compliance; and forensics and analysis.</li>
                        <li>Logs are the raw data generated by systems and provide detailed records of activities. And SIEM is a tool that aggregates, normalizes, and analyzes these logs in real-time to detect security threats, providing more advanced insights, automation, and compliance reporting.</li>
                        <li>While logs provide the foundational data, SIEM platforms use that data to enhance security monitoring and response, making SIEM an essential tool for managing and interpreting logs in the context of cybersecurity.</li>
                        <li>Example: Splunk, a popular SIEM platform that helps organizations monitor, analyze, and respond to security events and incidents.</li>

                    <h5>Intrusion Detection Systems :</h5>
                    <p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are security tools designed to detect unauthorized access or anomalies in a network or system. IDS monitors and analyzes network traffic, system activity, and user behavior to identify potential security breaches, such as cyberattacks or data theft, and alerts administrators to take action. IDS automate the inspection of logs and real-time system events to detect intrusion attempts and system failures.</p>
                    <h6>Type of IDS -</h6>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Network-based IDS (NIDS) :</b> HIDs monitor activity on individual devices or hosts (servers, computers). It is installed on the host device, where it monitors file integrity, system calls, and application logs. It detects internal threats and activities like unauthorized access to files and malicious changes to system configurations.</li>
                        <li><b>Host-based IDS (HIDS) :</b> NIDs monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. It is placed at strategic points within the network (e.g., between the internal network and the internet). It detects external attacks like denial-of-service (DoS) and port scanning.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Intrusion Prevention Systems :</h5>
                    <p>An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security device that monitors network and/or system activities for malicious activity. IPS is placed in line with traffic and is more advanced than an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). IPS not only detects but also automatically blocks or prevents the detected threats in real time to prevent unauthorized access or attacks on computer systems and networks. Since IPSs are more effective at preventing network-based attacks, their function is integrated into firewalls.</p>
                    <h6>Types of IPS -</h6>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Network-based IPS (NIPS) :</b> These are deployed at key points in the network (e.g., network perimeter) to monitor and protect the entire network.</li>
                        <li><b>Host-based IPS (HIPS) :</b> Installed on individual devices or hosts, HIPS protect against threats targeting a specific machine, such as a server or endpoint.</li>
                        <li><b>Wireless IPS (WIPS) :</b> A specialized IPS designed to protect wireless networks from unauthorized access or attacks.</li>

                    <h5>Firewalls :</h5>
                    <p>A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. These rules can be configured to permit or deny traffic based on factors such as IP address, port number, protocol, or specific applications. Firewalls can be hardware devices, software programs, or a combination of both. Firewalls use a variety of techniques to control and monitor network traffic, including packet filtering, stateful inspection, and application-level filtering. It blocks unauthorized access and filters out malicious traffic.</p>
                    <h6>Types of Firewall -</h6>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Network-based Firewall</b> : A network firewall is a device that protects an entire network from unauthorized access and attacks.

                    <h5>Eavesdropping (Sniffing) :</h5>
                    <p>Eavesdropping is the act of secretly intercepting and listening to private communications or data transmissions without the consent of the involved parties. It is often done to gather sensitive information, such as personal details, passwords, credit card numbers, or confidential business data. To prevent eavesdropping, encryption should be used for sensitive communications, and VPNs should be used to secure data over public networks.</p>
                    <h5>DNS Spoofing</h5>
                    <p>DNS Spoofing (also known as DNS Cache Poisoning) is an attack in which an attacker manipulates the Domain Name System (DNS) records to redirect or intercept users' web traffic. In a DNS spoofing attack, the attacker provides false DNS responses to a victim, causing the victim’s system to trust the malicious data. This can lead the victim to be redirected to malicious websites or servers, even though the domain name they entered was legitimate. To mitigate, use secure DNS servers, cache hygiene (regularly clearing DNS caches), and encryption.</p>
                    <h5>Malware Attacks :</h5>
                    <p>A malware attack refers to the process by which a malicious actor or software spreads or executes malware on a target system or network. Malware, short for malicious software, is any program or code designed to harm, exploit, or compromise the functionality of a computer, network, or device. Malware can lead to data theft, system damage, or a complete system takeover. Common types of malware include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.</p>

                        <li><b>Rootkit :</b> A rootkit is malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access to a system or network and hide its presence. It allows attackers to maintain privileged control (root access) over the system while remaining undetected, often by manipulating system processes or logs. Rootkits operate at a low system level, such as the kernel or firmware, making them difficult to detect with standard security software. Detecting and removing rootkits typically requires specialized tools or a complete system reformat.</li>
                        <li><b>Botnet :</b> A botnet is a network of infected computers or devices, known as "bots" or "zombies," that are controlled remotely by an attacker, often without the knowledge of the device's owner. These devices are typically compromised by malware and can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, spamming (sending large volumes of unsolicited emails), data theft, and mining cryptocurrency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Password Attacks :</h5>
                    <p>Passwords are often the primary means of authenticating users, and if compromised, they can provide access to sensitive data, systems, and resources.</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Brute Force Attack :</b> In a brute-force attack, the attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method involves testing all possible combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols, making it time-consuming but effective if the password is weak or simple. Countermeasures include using long and complex passwords, implementing account lockouts after multiple failed attempts, and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
                        <li><b>Dictionary Attack :</b> A dictionary attack involves using a dictionary, i.e., a prearranged list of common words, phrases, and frequently used passwords, to guess a password. The attacker typically uses a list of words from the dictionary, variations of common passwords, or leaked password lists. Countermeasures include using passwords that are not based on common words or dictionary phrases and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
                        <li><b>Rainbow Table Attack :</b> Rainbow tables are precomputed tables used to reverse cryptographic hash functions, converting hashed passwords back into plaintext. Attackers use precompiled tables of hash values corresponding to common passwords and attempt to match them with the hashes stored in a database. Countermeasures include using salting (adding random data) when storing passwords and employing strong cryptographic hashing algorithms like bcrypt.</li>
                        <li><b>Credential Stuffing :</b> Credential stuffing attacks use previously stolen username and password combinations (often from data breaches) to gain unauthorized access to multiple systems. Attackers automate the process of trying stolen credentials on various websites or services. If users reuse passwords across multiple sites, attackers can gain access to accounts on those platforms. Countermeasures include using never-reused passwords across different accounts, enabling MFA, and using password managers to generate and store unique passwords.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>MitM Attack :</h5>
                    <p>A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of cyberattack where an attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker positions themselves between the sender and the receiver, allowing them to eavesdrop on the conversation or modify the data being transmitted. This can occur in unsecured communication channels, like public Wi-Fi networks.</p>
                    <h5>Denial-of-Service Attack :</h5>
                    <p>In a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, an attacker attempts to disrupt the normal functioning of a target system, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic or requests. The goal is to make the targeted system unavailable to its users, effectively denying access to legitimate users. DoS attacks can result in downtime for websites, services, or networks, causing significant disruptions, financial losses, or reputational damage.</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>DoS (Denial of Service) :</b> In a traditional DoS attack, a single source or machine sends a massive volume of traffic to the target system, overwhelming its resources (such as bandwidth, memory, or CPU), causing the system to slow down or crash.</li>
                        <li><b>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) :</b> In a DDoS attack, the attacker uses multiple machines or devices (often part of a botnet) to flood the target system with traffic, making the attack more difficult to stop because it comes from many different sources.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>SQL Injection :</h5>
                    <p>Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi) is an attack on a web application's database that exploits vulnerabilities, allowing malicious SQL queries to be executed. This attack enables an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, often with the intent of gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or performing malicious actions on the database.</p>
                    <h5>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) :</h5>
                    <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications, where attackers inject malicious scripts (typically JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts execute within the user's browser, enabling the attacker to manipulate content, steal sensitive information, access cookies and session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent.</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Stored XSS :</b> The malicious script is stored on the server (for example, in a database) and is served to users who view the infected page.</li>
                        <li><b>Reflected XSS :</b> The malicious script is reflected off the web server (e.g., via a URL or query parameter) and executed immediately, usually without being stored.</li>
                        <li><b>DOM-based XSS :</b> The malicious script is executed as a result of modifying the DOM (Document Object Model) in the browser, often without involving the server.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Privilege Escalation :</h5>
                    <p>Privilege escalation is a type of security vulnerability or attack where an attacker gains elevated access to resources or functions that they would normally not be able to access. This occurs when a user, application, or process is granted higher privileges (e.g., admin or root rights) than intended.</p>
                    <ul class="justify">
                        <li><b>Vertical Privilege Escalation (or Privilege Elevation) :</b> This occurs when a user gains higher privileges, such as a regular user gaining administrative (root) access. For example, a standard user may exploit a vulnerability to gain administrator rights and perform actions that are normally restricted.</li>
                        <li><b>Horizontal Privilege Escalation :</b> This happens when an attacker gains access to another user's resources or data, but without increasing their own privileges. In this case, they can access or modify data that belongs to a different user with similar or equal privilege levels.</li>
                    </ul>
